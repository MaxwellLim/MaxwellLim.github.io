   <h3>Spoonified</h3>
   <p>This project included working with a team consisting of both computer science and electrical engineering majors on the design of a smart spoon which would track the 
pace and weight of bites that a person takes during a meal. I worked on the embedded code 
using C++, for the sensors of the spoon to be able to take the raw data and translate it to 
something which can be used to effectively track these metrics and communicate with a web 
app.</p>
