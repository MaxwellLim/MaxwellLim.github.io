 <h1>Maxwell Lim's Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Education</h2>
   <p>I am currently attending The University of Texas at Dallas for a Masters Degree in Computer Science with a specification in Data Science. 
    I have achieved a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas with a GPA of 3.27</p>
  <h2>Skills</h2>
   <p>I have worked with Java and C++ for 4 to 6 years in an educational setting</p>
   <p>I have worked with some basic knowledge of Python and R Programming Language.</p>
   <p>I have experience using Git/Github and also with many IDEs such as Visual Studio and JetBrains suite of tools. </p>
   
  <h2>Coursework</h2>
   <p>Intro to Machine Learning, Data Structures, Database Systems, Advanced Algorithms and Analysis, Computer Networks, Natural Language Processing, Statistical Methods for Data Science</p>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
   <h3>Spoonified - Senior Design Project</h3>
    <p>This project included working with a team consisting of both computer science and electrical engineering majors on the design of a smart spoon which would track the 
     pace and weight of bites that a person takes during a meal. I worked on the embedded code 
     using C++, for the sensors of the spoon to be able to take the raw data and translate it to 
     something which can be used to effectively track these metrics and communicate with a web 
     app.</p>
   <h3>Rules Based Chatbot</h3>
    <p>The project task was to create a web scraper and rules based chatbot using nlp techniques. In this project I used python with many packages such as NLTK and BeautifulSoup.
    I created a web crawler and scraper using BeautifulSoup to extract the text and hyperlinks from the html code. I then processed the text using various nlp techniques and TF-IDF to 
	extract the 40 most important terms from all of the texts that were scraped. With these terms, I created a small knowledge base with terms and sentences. 
	For the chatbot, I made an if-else tree to create a dialog flow with regex to guide it. The chatbot would also store the users information such as their name and number of visits,
	as well as the answers to a short survey when they close the chatbot.</p>
